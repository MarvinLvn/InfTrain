# Installation

Please follow instructions at `https://github.com/bootphon/zerospeech2021_baseline
In the following, we'll assume that experiments will be performed on the [Jean Zay cluster](http://www.idris.fr/annonces/annonce-jean-zay-eng.html). 

# Structure

All files generated by the experiments (training and evaluation) should be stored under `/gpfsscratch/rech/cfs/commun/experiments`.
Files should be organized as follows : 

```

The `trainers` folder contain scripts to train the different models (CPC, K-means, BERT, lstm).
The `experiments` folder contain scripts to generate the different experiments (training set, model, model parameters). These scripts should generate the configuration of each experiment in a `.txt` file whose each line will be submitted via a [slurm job array](http://www.idris.fr/jean-zay/cpu/jean-zay-cpu-exec_jobarray.html)
